                <p class="profile-description">
                    I'm a recent college grad currently applying for medical school this year.
                    In the meanwhile, I'm coding cool projects (like this website!), working on some research, and spending time with my family in the Bay Area, CA.
                    College apps are a stressful process&#8212I hope to make it more manageable for you!

                        It can be tough to make sense of your own high school journey.
                        My goal here is to help you decide on the activities that will form the <strong>personalized story</strong> you share with colleges.

                        Often, quality students struggle to express themselves or package their experiences into a coherent narrative.
                        I'll help you brainstorm and edit your personal statement and secondaries, and I'll guide you as you form stories that are <strong>clear</strong> and <strong>compelling</strong>.
                        My goal here is to help you learn how to present yourself to colleges!

                    Due to time constraints, I might not be able to take all students who need help,
                    but I highly recommend that you reach out to me by email.
